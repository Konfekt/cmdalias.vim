This plugin lets you define command-line abbreviations which only expand at the beginning of the command prompt.

You can pass in the optional flags

  -buffer  or  -range

to create buffer local aliases or ones that accept a range that precedes the
aliased command.

These command line abbreviations work like the bash aliases, except that
the alias is substituted in-place.

USAGE

    :Alias [-range] [-buffer] <lhs> <rhs>

    or

    :call CmdAlias(['-range'], ['-buffer'], '<lhs>', '<rhs>')

    :UnAlias <lhs> ...
    :Aliases [<lhs> ...]

Examples:

    :Alias   -range   dg   <c-r>=&l:diff?"diffget":"dg"<cr>
    :Alias   -buffer  spl  setlocal\ spell<bar>setlocal\ spelllang=en
    :Alias            w!!  write\ !sudo\ tee\ >\ /dev/null\ %
    :Alias            F    find\ *<c-r>=EatChar("\ ")<cr>
    :Alias            th   tab\ help
    :Alias            sft  setfiletype
    :Alias            g    !git
    :UnAlias          g
    :Aliases

  See :help abbreviations for Eatchar(c).

CONFIGURATION

The variable 'g:cmdaliasCmdPrefixes' lists the patterns of all commands by
which an alias command may be preceded and yet expand. It defaults to

  ['\d*verb\(ose\)\?', 'debug', 'sil\(ent\)\?!\?', 'redir\?!\?']

---

This plugin is based and improves on cmdalias.vim 3. 0 by Hari Krishna Dara by

- allowing for aliases of commands preceded by a range (like :Alias -range dg
  diffget),
- allowing for alias names ending in non-word chars (like :Alias w!! ...),
- having a Vim documentation, and
- more checks for proper usage, more consistent parameter parsing and a finer
  check for blanks or commands (such as :  silent! ) preceding the alias.
